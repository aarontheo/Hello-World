# Rust "Hello World" programs
Programs in Rust can be written from scratch or built using a project manager, such as Cargo.

Hence, there are two examples in this directory, one using the manager and one without.

## Instructions for Build and Use

### hello_world
Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Compile `main.rs` by running the shell command `rustc main.rs` in the project directory.
2. Run the compiled file, `main`, by running `./main` in the project directory.

### hello_cargo
Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Compile and run the project by running the shell command `cargo run` from the project directory.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* `rustc 1.77.2` (Rust Compiler)
* `cargo 1.77.2` (Rust project manager)
* `rustup 1.27.0` (Rust toolchain updater/installer) 

(You'll need to use RustUp if you don't have rustc or cargo installed)
